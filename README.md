# E-Commerce Frontend

This project is a modern Frontend E-commerce application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command in the project root directory to install all required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables** (If applicable):
   If there is a `.env.example` file, copy it to create your own `.env` file and fill in any necessary values for your local environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   Start the application locally by running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/` (or the port specified in your terminal). Any changes you make to the code will automatically hot-reload in the browser.

## 🛠️ Building for Production

To create an optimized production-ready build, run:
```bash
npm run build
